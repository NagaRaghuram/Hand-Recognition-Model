>> Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project is a Python-based real-time hand gesture recognition system that uses OpenCV and NumPy. The model captures video input from a webcam, detects a
hand within a defined region, and recognizes simple gestures like waving, pointing, and finger counting. The recognized gestures are then displayed on the video feed.

>> Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection and recognition.
- Detects gestures like waving, pointing, and counting fingers.
- Displays recognized gestures as text overlay on the video feed.
- Easy-to-extend architecture for adding more gestures.

>> Installation

> Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

>> Installing Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy


>>Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/NagaRaghuram/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition

>>Usage:
-Run the hand_gesture_recognition.py script
-The program will open your webcam and start detecting hand gestures. To stop the program, press the x key.

>>How It Works
-Background Subtraction: The program captures the background for a few initial frames and uses it to isolate the hand from the background.
-Region of Interest: The script focuses on a specific region of the video frame where the hand is expected to appear.
-Gesture Recognition:
(1)Waving: Detected by analyzing the horizontal movement of the hand.
(2)Finger Counting: The number of fingers is counted by detecting contours intersecting a line across the hand.
(3)Output: The recognized gesture is displayed as text on the video feed, providing real-time feedback.

>>Potential Applications
-Human-Computer Interaction: Control applications through gestures instead of traditional input devices.
-Gesture-Controlled Devices: Interact with smart devices using hand gestures.
-Assistive Technology: Help individuals with disabilities control devices using gestures.
-Gaming: Integrate into gaming systems for more interactive experiences.
